# LinkedIn MCP

A local Electron desktop app that drives **LinkedIn** through a real, Playwright-controlled Chromium browser and exposes that automation to **Claude Desktop** (or any MCP client) as an **MCP server over stdio**.

Instead of using LinkedIn's (restricted) official API, the app logs in as you in a real browser window, keeps the session alive on disk, and lets an AI assistant call a small set of well-defined tools (view a profile, search people/jobs/companies, send a message, send a connection request, read the feed and notifications, etc.). You stay in control: login is manual and headed, so you complete any 2FA/captcha yourself, and your password is never stored.

> **Heads-up / status:** this repository currently has a number of wiring bugs between the Electron main process and the driver/MCP layers (mismatched import paths, method names, and constructor signatures). See the "Known issues" section at the bottom. The README below describes the *intended* design and usage.

---

## What it does

- **Headed, persistent browser session.** Launches one Chromium via `chromium.launchPersistentContext()` with an on-disk profile, plus a portable `storageState` snapshot for fast validation and recovery.
- **Control panel UI.** An Electron window shows driver/session status, a sign-in panel, an MCP-client indicator, and a live activity log. The app also lives in the system tray and keeps running in the background as an MCP server.
- **MCP server over stdio.** Exposes LinkedIn actions as MCP tools so Claude Desktop can call them. All diagnostics go to stderr so the JSON-RPC stream on stdout stays clean.
- **Rate-limit-aware automation.** Every state-changing action is paced (>= ~2s with jitter) and selectors prefer ARIA/`data-*`/semantic anchors over LinkedIn's randomized CSS classes.

---

## Quick start (npx)

No clone required — run the MCP server straight from npm:

```bash
npx -y @hamzah1528cloud-web/linkedin-mcp
```

The first install downloads Playwright's Chromium automatically (via the `postinstall` hook). The server speaks MCP over stdio, so it's normally launched by an MCP client rather than by hand — add it to your client config (see [Connecting to an MCP client](#connecting-to-an-mcp-client)). On first use, call the `linkedin_login` tool: a headed Chromium window opens so you can sign in (and clear any 2FA/captcha) once; the session is then persisted under `~/.linkedin-mcp` for future runs.

```bash
npx -y @hamzah1528cloud-web/linkedin-mcp --help      # usage + config snippet
npx -y @hamzah1528cloud-web/linkedin-mcp --version
```

The same package also ships the optional Electron desktop control panel (tray + activity log) — see [How to run](#how-to-run) to build it from source.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 20+** (the project targets ES2022 / modern Electron).
- **npm** (ships with Node).
- **Playwright's Chromium browser.** Installed automatically by the `postinstall` script, or manually:

```bash
npx playwright install chromium
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

This also runs `playwright install chromium` via the `postinstall` hook.

---

## How to run

> Just want the MCP server? Use the [npx quick start](#quick-start-npx). This section covers the optional Electron desktop app, built from a source checkout.

```bash
npm start
```

This launches the Electron control panel (UI mode). From there you can:

1. **Start Driver** – launches the persistent Chromium.
2. **Sign In** – opens LinkedIn's login page in the controlled browser. Enter your credentials and complete any 2FA/captcha **manually** in that window. Once you reach the feed, the session is persisted.
3. Watch the **Session** panel flip to *authenticated* and the **Activity Log** for progress.

To rebuild the compiled output (main + renderer) without packaging:

```bash
npm run build       # tsc for main/driver/mcp + renderer + copy index.html
npm run typecheck   # type-check only, no emit
```

Packaging (requires the missing `assets/` and `build/` files, see Known issues):

```bash
npm run pack        # unpacked build
npm run dist        # platform installer(s)
```

---

## Connecting to an MCP client

MCP clients discover servers from a JSON config — for Claude Desktop:

- **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\\Claude\\claude_desktop_config.json`

(Claude Code: `claude mcp add`; other clients use the same `command`/`args` shape.)

### Recommended — npx (no checkout)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "linkedin": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@hamzah1528cloud-web/linkedin-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Optional `env` overrides: `LINKEDIN_MCP_USERDATA` (data/profile dir, default `~/.linkedin-mcp`) and `LINKEDIN_HEADLESS=1` (run Chromium headless — but keep it headed for the first login).

### Alternative — Electron desktop app (from a source checkout)

Runs the same MCP server embedded in the tray app, so you get a control-panel window alongside it:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "linkedin": {
      "command": "./node_modules/.bin/electron",
      "args": ["."],
      "cwd": "/absolute/path/to/linkedin-mcp",
      "env": { "LINKEDIN_MCP_STDIO": "1" }
    }
  }
}
```

Notes:
- **Restart the client** after editing the config.
- Both paths share the same persistent session on disk, so logging in once via either is enough.
- The MCP server keeps stdout reserved for JSON-RPC; all diagnostics go to stderr.

## MCP tools

All tools are namespaced `linkedin_*`. Auth/status tools work without being logged in; every data/action tool requires an authenticated session (call `linkedin_login` first).

| Tool | Arguments | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `linkedin_login` | `email?`, `password?` | Opens the headed login flow. Optionally pre-fills credentials; you finish 2FA/captcha by hand. Waits for the session, then persists it. The password is never stored. |
| `linkedin_logout` | – | Clears the saved `storageState` snapshot and the profile cookies; next action needs a fresh login. |
| `linkedin_status` | – | Returns `{ status, isLoggedIn, sessionValid }`. Works before the browser is launched. |
| `linkedin_get_profile` | `profileUrl` (full URL or `/in/` slug) | Opens and scrapes a member profile: name, headline, location, about, experience, education, skills, connection count. |
| `linkedin_search_people` | `query`, `filters?` | People search; returns name, headline, location, profile URL, connection degree. |
| `linkedin_search_jobs` | `query`, `filters?` | Jobs search; returns title, company, location, posted date, easy-apply, job URL. |
| `linkedin_search_companies` | `query`, `filters?` | Company search; returns name, industry, followers, company URL. |
| `linkedin_send_message` | `profileUrl`, `message` | Sends a DM to a 1st-degree/open-profile member. Fails clearly if messaging isn't permitted. |
| `linkedin_send_connection` | `profileUrl`, `note?` (<=300 chars) | Sends a connection request, optionally with a note. Returns outcome: sent / already_sent / already_connected / unavailable. |
| `linkedin_get_feed` | `limit?` (1–50, default 10) | Reads home-feed posts: author, text, timestamp, like/comment counts, post URL. |
| `linkedin_get_notifications` | `limit?` (1–50, default 20) | Reads notifications: type, actor, text, timestamp, URL, read/unread. |
| `linkedin_get_conversations` | – | Lists inbox threads: participant, snippet, conversation id, timestamp, unread state. |

Each tool returns a JSON payload inside the standard MCP text-content envelope. On failure the result carries `isError: true` with an actionable message (e.g. "Not logged in to LinkedIn. Run linkedin_login…").

> The advertised `filters` schemas for the search tools are richer than the filters the driver currently applies; treat advanced filters as best-effort for now (see Known issues).

---

## Session persistence

Two cooperating layers keep you logged in across restarts:

1. **Persistent Chromium profile (primary).** The browser runs against an on-disk profile directory (`<userData>/playwright-profile`). Cookies, localStorage, and IndexedDB live there and survive app restarts on their own — exactly like a normal browser that "remembers" you.

2. **Portable `storageState` snapshot (secondary).** On login (and on graceful close) the app also writes `<userData>/linkedin-session.json`. This gives:
   - a fast, **browser-free** "am I logged in?" check by inspecting the LinkedIn `li_at` cookie and its expiry (no Chromium launch required), and
   - a **recovery path**: if the profile is corrupted, a fresh context can be re-hydrated by re-injecting the snapshot's cookies via `context.addCookies(...)`.

`<userData>` is Electron's per-app data directory (e.g. `~/Library/Application Support/LinkedIn MCP/` on macOS). Outside Electron it falls back to `$LINKEDIN_MCP_USERDATA` or `~/.linkedin-mcp`.

**Validity** is determined by the presence of a non-expired `li_at` cookie. A session cookie (`expires === -1`) is treated as valid. `linkedin_status` / the UI surface this as `sessionValid`, while `isLoggedIn` additionally confirms against the live page when a context is up.

**Logging out** (`linkedin_logout` / the Logout button) clears the profile cookies and deletes the snapshot, forcing a fresh manual login next time.

The session files contain live credentials-equivalent cookies — `.gitignore` already excludes `userData/`, `pw-profile/`, and any `storageState.json`. **Never commit a logged-in session.**

## Configuration (`.env`)

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`. All values are optional:

- `LINKEDIN_EMAIL` / `LINKEDIN_PASSWORD` – optional pre-fill for auto-login. **Not recommended**; manual headed login is preferred and required for 2FA/captcha accounts.
- `MCP_LOG_LEVEL` – `error|warn|info|debug|trace`.
- `LINKEDIN_MCP_STDIO` – set to `1` when launched by Claude Desktop as a stdio MCP server (the config injects this).
- `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` – override the Playwright browsers location (packaged builds point this at the bundled Chromium).

## Known issues

This codebase does **not** yet build/run cleanly. The main process, the driver facade, and the MCP/IPC layers were written against slightly different APIs. The most important mismatches:

- **Wrong import paths in `src/main`.** `index.ts` and `ipc-handlers.ts` import `./driver/PlaywrightDriver` and `./mcp/server`, but the real files are `../driver/linkedin` and `../mcp/server`. There is no `PlaywrightDriver` file or `createDriver` export (use `getInstance()` / `LinkedInDriver`).
- **`linkedin.ts` imports `./actions/messaging`** but the file is `actions/messages.ts`.
- **Driver facade vs. main process contract drift:** the main process treats the driver as an `EventEmitter` (`driver.on('status', …)`) and reads `getStatus().state`, neither of which the driver provides (`getStatus()` returns `{ status, isLoggedIn, sessionValid }`).
- **MCP server API:** `index.ts` imports `getMcpStatus` and calls `startMcpServer({ driver, transport })`, but `server.ts` exposes no `getMcpStatus` and `startMcpServer()` takes no arguments.
- **IPC handler method names don't match the action modules:** e.g. `profile.view` (should be `getProfile`), `search.people/jobs/companies(query, page)` (should be `searchPeople/searchJobs/searchCompanies(query, filters?)`), `connection.sendRequest` (should be `connections.sendConnectionRequest`), `message.send` (should be `messages.sendMessage`), `notifications.list` (should be `feed.getNotifications`), `feed.read` (should be `feed.getFeed`), and `auth.login({email,password})` (should be `login(email, password)`).
- **`AuthActions` constructor mismatch:** `linkedin.ts` builds `new AuthActions(page, session, {email,password})`, but the constructor is `(page, paths?)`.
- **`tsconfig.json` path aliases** point at non-existent `src/main/driver`, `src/main/mcp`, `src/shared`.
- **Packaging assets missing:** `electron-builder.json` references `assets/icon.*`, `build/entitlements.mac.plist`, and `node_modules/playwright-core/.local-browsers` (the project installs `playwright`, not `playwright-core`); `package.json`'s `register-mcp` script points at a non-existent `scripts/register-mcp.ts`.
- _(Resolved)_ MCP mode detection: the Electron entry now keys off `LINKEDIN_MCP_STDIO=1` / `--mcp` / a non-TTY stdout, matching the config above. The standalone `npx` binary (`dist/cli.js`) needs no such flag — it is always an MCP stdio server.

Reconcile these before expecting `npm run build` / `npm start` to succeed.
